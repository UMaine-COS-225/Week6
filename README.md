# Week 6

Instructions - Based on the UML class diagram we saw on Thursday, this repository implements some of the structure of the app.

The difference is that we are now storing things now just in the root folder but in Java Packages.

EXERCISE: Implement the rest of the .java files and add them to the relevant package.
